INSTRUCTIONS:

> Compile the .mod files in the "morphology" folder. 
    - https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/static/docs/nmodl/unix.html  for unix-based OS
    - https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/static/docs/nmodl/mswin.html  for windows-based OS

> The "morphology" folder contains files that generate the reconstructed neuronal morphology and also allocate all non-synaptic 
  mechanisms required.
	- You can browse the files therein if you want, but they are written in pure NEURON, not NEURON/Python, so be warned!
	- You should not have to tweak the files in the "morphology" folder in any way. If you think you should, let me know!
	- The folder also contains files that model synaptic mechanisms ('ampa.mod', 'NMDA_syn.mod', 'gabaa.mod'), as well
	  as a file that can be used to "play back" pre-generated inputs for synapses ('vecstim.mod'). You can make use of all
	  of these files, or none of them - it is up to you. They are provided for your convenience, if you want to use them.

		  section_name                                  # to access a specific section (the target of your synapses)
		  my_synapse_ampa = h.GLU(synapse_position)     # allocates a single AMPA synapse at "synapse_position" (0-1)
		  my_synapse_nmda = h.nmda(synapse_position)    # allocates a single NMDA synapse at "synapse_position" (0-1)

> Verify that your copy of the model functions as intended by running the model file (v1_pcell_model.py). 
	- The code in the file already contains a simple functionality test with a dual pulse current injection, intended to generate
	  an action potential, shown in a simple plot.
	- This verification code is not required to continue the project.

> Move towards achieving the goals of the project as stated:
	- Main Question: "Can dendrite-bound attentional signals modulate the activity of orientation selective neurons?"

	Milestones:
	- Allocate a single synapse and ensure correct function
	- Allocate multiple synapses according to a set plan 
	- Ensure that stimulus-driven synapses feature orientation selectivity
	- Implement a subset of synapses as attentional (feedback) inputs
	- Allocate all synapses (feedforward & feedback)
	- Show that the neuron exhibits orientation tuning (tuning curve/OSI)
	- Investigate the effect of attention on neuronal output
	- Demonstrate the effect (or lack thereof) of attention
	- Is there something else you'd like to check using the model? You may do so at your discretion!
	- Present your results!
